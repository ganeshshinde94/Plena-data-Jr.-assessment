                        ## First Not Repeated Character ##

This small aplication is written in Python programming language.

If you are using any python editor then just run the code file and it will ask you to enter the string
and after that pres enter and it will display first not repeated character and after that it will display
the rewrited string as mentioned in the problem statement.

If you are running a python application in CLI then just write "python file_name" and Enter
It will ask to to enter the string...Use single or double quotes to enter the string ex. "Bubble" and enter
It will display the output in the CLI

Time Complexity - O(n) where n is the no of characters in the string
Space Complexity - O(n)
